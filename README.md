## Install

Node `0.10` or greater:

Or:

Clone the master branch, add the `bin/` folder to your `$PATH`, run `make install` in the project root directory to install dependencies.

## Usage

Docs are hosted on the [wiki](https://github.com/thibaultCha/Miranda/wiki), but below is a sample so you can see how simple it is to use.

### Commands

`$ miranda -h`: prints help.

`$ miranda create [path]`

`$ miranda build [path]`

`$ miranda serve [path] -p [port]`

`$ miranda new <page|post> [path]`

`path` always refers to a directory containing a `config.yml` file. If no `path` is provided, the command targets the current directory.

`$ miranda about`

### Build your first website

`$ miranda create ~/Desktop/test`

`$ miranda serve ~/Desktop/test`

Browse to `http://localhost:8888`. That's it. (By the way, pull request about the base template are welcomed too).

## Roadmap

- live update on directory changes

## Development

Clone the sources and run `$ make dev` to install all dependencies.

`$ make test`: runs the tests.

`$ make test-cov`: runs the coverage.
